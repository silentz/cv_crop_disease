# CGIAR Computer Vision for Crop Disease

This is the project for [CGIAR Computer Vision for Crop Disease](https://zindi.africa/competitions/iclr-workshop-challenge-1-cgiar-computer-vision-for-crop-disease/)
&mdash; computer vision competition for identification wheat rust in images from Ethiopia and Tanzania.
It addresses problem of multiclass classification, where every image of crop is labeled as healthy or having one
of two deseases. My approach is originally based on resnet18 &mdash; pretrained convolutional neural network that
can classify images into 1000 categories.
